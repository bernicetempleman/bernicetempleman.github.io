    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Experienced Software Engineer, Senior Systems Analyst, Technical Support Engineer, Computer Programmer, Linux, and
      Unix System Administrator.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p>
      I am a Software Developer with experience in ServiceNow administration, implementation, and integration.
      Previously I graduated from the Florida Institute of Technology with a master's degree in computer information
      systems in December 2016. I continued with doctoral studies at Colorado Technical University after my master’s
      degree.
      </p>
      <p>
      After working as a system administrator and technical support engineer for several years, I decided to shift my
      career to software development. Since shifting careers, I have worked on several projects and gained valuable
      experience in technologies on Java, web applications, and mobile app development. I enjoy programming and enjoy
      learning new development technologies, which is the reason I am currently working as a ServiceNow Developer
      through Revature. I hope to become a senior developer in a few years to mentor others, possibly including others
      trying to make career shifts as I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time at Revature, I’ve worked on several projects where I gained experience in ServiceNow Development,
      Administration, ITSM, and ITIL.
    </p>

    <p>
      * Programmed using Business Rules, Script Includes, Data policies, UI Policies, UI Actions, and Client Scripts
    </p>
    <p>
      * Used ServiceNow Workflows, Flow Design, App Engine Studio, and Service Portal
    </p>
    <p>
      * Worked on projects using frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, Typescript, and Angular)
    </p>
    <p>
      * Demonstrated skills in data management, solving problems, and being able to work collaboratively within a team
      or independently
    </p>
    <p>
      * Self-starter and excited to explore new solutions
    </p>
    <p>
      * Strong oral and written communication skills
